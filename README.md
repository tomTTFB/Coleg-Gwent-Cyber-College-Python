# Python Learning Scripts

This repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts I created while learning the basics of Python programming. These examples cover fundamental concepts like input/output, data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets), math operations, and basic applications. They're meant to practice core skills in an interactive way.

## Installation
No special setup needed – just Python 3.x.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Coleg-Gwent-Cyber-College-Python.git
   ```
   (Update with your actual repo URL.)

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd Coleg-Gwent-Cyber-College-Python
   ```

3. Run scripts with:
   ```
   python filename.py
   ```

## Usage
Each script runs independently from the command line. Many include user prompts for interactivity. Use a terminal to execute them.

Example:
```
python main.py
```

## Scripts
Brief overviews of the scripts I built:

- **main.py**: Basic "Hello World" with user input for name and age, including integer conversion.

- **basicio.py**: Simple input/output, string joining, and list basics like adding items and looping through them.

- **list.py**: Working with lists – accessing, adding user-input fruits, and updating elements.

- **dictionary.py**: Creating and using dictionaries for a student-like profile, accessing/updating values.

- **tuples.py**: Tuples for coordinates, showing access and unpacking.

- **data-mathexplorer.py**: Interactive script combining personal data input with math ops (add, subtract, etc.) and data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dicts).

- **deathstar.py**: Fun calc for sphere volume (Death Star) using math.pi and hardcoded diameter.

- **smoothie.py**: Smoothie cost estimator with input validation, error handling, and conditionals.
